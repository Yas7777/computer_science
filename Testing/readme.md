  
**Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. Testing helps identify defects, errors, or gaps in the software and verifies that the product is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.**

Testing can be divided into functional and non-functional testing. To start with, I am going to describe functional testing:   
  
**Functional Testing:** This is a type of software testing that verifies the functionality of a software system or application. The following are the different types of functional testing methods:  
  
**Unit Testing:**  
•  Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested in isolation. It is typically done by developers to ensure that each unit of the software performs as designed.  
•  The goal is to validate that each unit of the software works correctly and handles different inputs and edge cases as expected.  
•  These tests can usually be automated.  

**Integration Testing:**  
•  Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group to verify that they work together correctly. It focuses on testing the interfaces and interactions between different modules or components of a system.  
•  The goal is to detect any defects or issues that arise when integrating various parts of the system.  
•  Integration testing is performed after unit testing and before system testing.  

**System Testing:**  
•  System testing is a level of software testing where the complete and fully integrated software is tested as a whole to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements.  
•  It is performed after integration testing.  
•  The goal is to verify that the system meets the functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, reliability, and security.  

**Acceptance Testing:**  
•  Acceptance testing is a level of testing where the system is tested for acceptability by the end-users.   
•  It is performed after system testing and before the system is deployed to production.  
•  The goal is to ensure that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable for use.  

**Regression Testing:**  
•  Regression testing is performed to verify that changes or updates to the software have not adversely affected the existing functionality.  
•  It involves re-executing a subset of previously executed tests to ensure that the system still functions correctly after modifications.  

**Performance Testing:**  
•  Performance testing is a type of testing that evaluates how the system performs under different loads and conditions.  
•  It measures the responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization of the system under varying workloads.  
•  The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and ensure that the system meets the desired performance criteria.  

**Smoke Testing:**  
•  Smoke testing is performed on initial builds to determine whether they are stable or not.  
•  Whenever developers release a new build, the testing team carries out smoke tests to ensure the core functionalities work as expected.  
•  The goal is to ensure the build is stable enough for further testing.   
•  It is also known as Build Verification Testing or Confidence Testing.   


*Unit testing focuses on individual components, while integration testing verifies the interactions between components. System testing evaluates the complete system, and acceptance testing ensures that the system meets business requirements. Regression testing verifies that changes have not introduced new defects, and performance testing measures the system's behavior under different loads. These practices work together to create reliable, efficient, and thoroughly tested software systems.*  
  
**Testing Strategies**  
  
Testing strategies describe how testing is approached and conducted:  
  
**Black Box Testing:**  
• Black box testing is a method of software testing that examines the  functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings.   
• This type of testing is typically conducted by testers who  evaluate the software from an end-user perspective.      
• The goal is  to verify that the software functions as expected based on the specified requirements and to identify any  discrepancies.

**Grey Box Testing:**  
• Grey box testing is a method of software testing that involves having some knowledge of the internal workings of the application, but not as much as white box testing.      
• This approach combines aspects of both black box and white box testing.    
• The goal is to design test cases based on a limited understanding of the internal logic and  structure of the system, allowing for more thorough testing of both functionality and potential edge cases.

**White Box Testing:**  
• White box testing involves testing the internal structures or workings of an application. 
• It is typically done by developers who have knowledge of the internal code and architecture.
• The goal is to verify the internal operations of the system, including paths, branches, and loops.
  
There are “testing development frameworks” as well to consider:  

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**  
•  TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. TDD emphasizes writing small, focused tests that drive the development of the software incrementally.  
•  The development process follows a cycle of writing a failing test, writing the minimal code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code.  
•  It promotes better design, maintainability, and confidence in the code by ensuring that the software is thoroughly tested at every stage of development.  

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**  
•  BDD is an agile software development approach that combines practices from TDD and domain-driven design (DDD).  
•  It focuses on defining the behavior of the system from the perspective of its stakeholders.  
•  The scenarios serve as a basis for collaboration, communication, and automated testing.  

**Non-Functional Testing:** This is a type of software testing that verifies non-functional elements of the application, such as security, reliability, performance, and scalability. Below are the different types of non-functional testing methods:   

**Load Testing**  
•  Load testing checks how the application performs under normal and peak conditions.   
•  It is conducted on a dedicated server which simulates the real environment.  
•  The goal is to measure how much work the application can handle before it is negatively affected. If the system degrades under load, then changes are made to prevent such issues.  

**Performance Testing**  
•  This test verifies the performance of the application while subjecting it to real-world scenarios.  
•  In this test, parameters such as response time and efficiency of resource usage are monitored.   
•  The goal of performance testing is to check how strongly the software components work.  

**Stress Testing**  
•  Stress testing subjects the system to conditions that will not happen under normal circumstances.  
•  It measures the limit at which the application breaks.  
•  The goal of this test is to find out how the system works under stressful conditions. It answers these questions: does the system fail? How well will it recover if it crashes?    

**Volume Testing**  
•  Volume testing evaluates the behavior of the application when a large volume of data is added to the database.   
•  Also known as flood testing, it identifies the problems related to large amounts of data.   
•  Volume testing is important for validating system performance and stability.
